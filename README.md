# Rock Paper Scissors Game

# Project Description
 Rock Paper Scissors Game Project for Week 8 Class Build for MMED 1054.

# Ok but what is this game?

I have built this Rock, Paper and Scissors game following the class builds from MMED-1054. The key objetive here was to learn the basics of python and its features.

It is a simple game where the objective is to defeat the opponent by choosing the right weapons.

The player who runs out of lifes, lose. Simple as that.
